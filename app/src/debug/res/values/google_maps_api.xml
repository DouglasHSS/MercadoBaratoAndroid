    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=9F:60:1F:A6:13:34:14:C6:C9:3C:43:33:EB:00:C3:0B:2E:30:0B:83%3Bcom.br.cdr.mercadobarato

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    9F:60:1F:A6:13:34:14:C6:C9:3C:43:33:EB:00:C3:0B:2E:30:0B:83;com.br.cdr.mercadobarato

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">
        YOUR_KEY_HERE
    </string>
